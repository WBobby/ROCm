# AMD ROCm Software

ROCm is an open-source stack, composed primarily of open-source software, designed for graphics
processing unit (GPU) computation. ROCm consists of a collection of drivers, development tools, and
APIs that enable GPU programming from low-level kernel to end-user applications.

With ROCm, you can customize your GPU software to meet your specific needs. You can develop,
collaborate, test, and deploy your applications in a free, open source, integrated, and secure software
ecosystem. ROCm is particularly well-suited to GPU-accelerated high-performance computing (HPC),
artificial intelligence (AI), scientific computing, and computer aided design (CAD).

ROCm is powered by AMDâ€™s
[Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP)](https://github.com/ROCm/HIP),
an open-source software C++ GPU programming environment and its corresponding runtime. HIP
allows ROCm developers to create portable applications on different platforms by deploying code on a
range of platforms, from dedicated gaming GPUs to exascale HPC clusters.

ROCm supports programming models, such as OpenMP and OpenCL, and includes all necessary open
source software compilers, debuggers, and libraries. ROCm is fully integrated into machine learning
(ML) frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Getting the ROCm Source Code

AMD ROCm is built from open source software. It is, therefore, possible to modify the various components of ROCm by downloading the source code and rebuilding the components. The source code for ROCm components can be cloned from each of the GitHub repositories using git.  For easy access to download the correct versions of each of these tools, the ROCm repository contains a repo manifest file called [default.xml](./default.xml). You can use this manifest file to download the source code for ROCm software.

### Installing the repo tool

The repo tool from Google allows you to manage multiple git repositories simultaneously. Run the following commands to install the repo tool:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin/
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
```

**Note:** The ```~/bin/``` folder is used as an example. You can specify a different folder to install the repo tool into if you desire.

### Installing git-lfs

Some ROCm projects use the Git Large File Storage (LFS) format that may require you to install git-lfs. Refer to [Git Large File Storage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/INSTALLING.md) for more information. For example, to install git-lfs for Ubuntu, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

### Downloading the ROCm source code

The following example shows how to use the repo tool to download the ROCm source code. If you choose a directory other than ~/bin/ to install the repo tool, you must use that chosen directory in the code as shown below:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ROCm/
cd ~/ROCm/
~/bin/repo init -u http://github.com/ROCm/ROCm.git -b roc-6.0.x
~/bin/repo sync
```

**Note:** Using this sample code will cause the repo tool to download the open source code associated with the specified ROCm release. Ensure that you have ssh-keys configured on your machine for your GitHub ID prior to the download as explained at [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

### Building the ROCm source code

Each ROCm component repository contains directions for building that component, such as the rocSPARSE documentation [Installation and Building for Linux](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocSPARSE/en/latest/install/Linux_Install_Guide.html). Refer to the specific component documentation for instructions on building the repository.

Each release of the ROCm software supports specific hardware and software configurations. Refer to [System requirements (Linux)](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html) for the current supported hardware and OS.

### Build ROCm from source in docker

#### Pulling base docker images

```bash
# Ubuntu20.04 built from docker/ubuntu20/Dockerfile.prebuild
docker pull compute-artifactory.amd.com:5000/rocm-base-images/ubuntu-20.04-bld:2024050301
# Ubuntu22.04 built from docker/ubuntu22/Dockerfile.prebuild
docker pull compute-artifactory.amd.com:5000/rocm-base-images/ubuntu-22.04-bld:2024050301

# clone source code
mkdir -p ~/ROCm/
cd ~/ROCm/
export ROCM_VERSION=6.1.0   # or 6.1.1
~/bin/repo init -u http://github.com/WBobby/ROCm.git -b roc-6.1.x -m rocm-build/rocm-${ROCM_VERSION}.xml
~/bin/repo sync

# Enter source code folder (follow downloading the ROCm source code)
cd ~/ROCm/
docker run -ti \
    -e CCACHE_DIR=$HOME/.ccache \
    -e CCACHE_ENABLED=true \
    -e DOCK_WORK_FOLD=/src \
    -w /src \
    -v $PWD:/src \
    -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd \
    -v /etc/shadow:/etc/shadow \
    -v ${HOME}/.ccache:${HOME}/.ccache \
    -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    <replace_with_required_ubuntu_base_docker_image> bash

## ROCm documentation

This repository contains the [manifest file](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/HEAD/docs/manifest-format.md)
for ROCm releases, changelogs, and release information.

The `default.xml` file contains information for all repositories and the associated commit used to build
the current ROCm release; `default.xml` uses the [Manifest Format repository](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/).

Source code for our documentation is located in the `/docs` folder of most ROCm repositories. The
`develop` branch of our repositories contains content for the next ROCm release.

The ROCm documentation homepage is [rocm.docs.amd.com](https://rocm.docs.amd.com).

### Building the documentation

For a quick-start build, use the following code. For more options and detail, refer to
[Building documentation](./docs/contribute/building.md).

```bash
cd docs
pip3 install -r sphinx/requirements.txt
python3 -m sphinx -T -E -b html -d _build/doctrees -D language=en . _build/html
```

Alternatively, CMake build is supported.

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --target=doc
```
